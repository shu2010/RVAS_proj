Round2 directory contains analysis performed using the following filtering conditions applied on the DISCOVERY set:
VAF >= 0.35 & Eigenphred(C3) >= 3
This was done to mitigate the burden of C3 variants. 

Note that the MGRB CHIP cases here are also chosen from sep2018 DT_sheet.
The MGRB CHIP cases donot match with the CHIP2 results, but is still valid since the number of MGRB is almost 2X the ISKS and is fair to subsample from MGBRB.
