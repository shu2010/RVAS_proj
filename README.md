# RVAS_proj
Multiple SKAT tests are implemented in R to enable analysis of rare variant tests in a highly customisable manner.
Details regarding the scope of analysis will be updated shortly.

Summary
1. Extract coding variants from high confidence tiers(prescribed by GIAB) of the genome
2. Perform kernel machine regression based association test
3. Variants that are positively correlated to the phenotype are selectively chosen
4. PPI graph based enrichment (Community/Clique detection)
5. Ontology based enrichment
